CONFIGURATION</h3>

The only configuration to be
done is to establish the path to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ArmyOps.exe</span>
file. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ArmyOps.exe</span>
file is located in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">System folder</span>
of the game installation directory.<br>

<br>

You can also choose the language. Currently <span style="font-weight: bold;">English</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spanish</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">German</span>,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dutch and Korean</span> are available.<br>

<br>

Do not forget to click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save
Settings</span> button to save the changes.<br>

<br>

It is not necessary to change the <span style="font-weight: bold;">UDP</span>
port unless this port is busy.<br>

<br>

You also have the option to adjust the screen resolution of the game.
You have fullscreen mode and window mode.<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="HOW_TO_CHOOSE_A_SERVER_TO_PLAY"></a>HOW
TO CHOOSE A SERVER TO PLAY</h3>

To
choose a server you should look at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PING</span>
value. The higher the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PING</span>
value the more lag you will experience in the game. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You must should try
to choose the server that has the lowest Ping</span>.<br>

<br>

It is recommended that you choose the green server that has the lowest
value of <span style="font-weight: bold;">PING</span> to enjoy
excellent gameplay.<br>

<br>

About
the Yellow and Red servers it's up to you to see if you get acceptable
playability on those servers. (will need to see how much lag issues you
get)<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> the green
servers have values less than <span style="font-weight: bold;">150</span>,
the yellow servers have values
between <span style="font-weight: bold;">150</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">250</span>, and the red servers are those
with Ping values
greater than <span style="font-weight: bold;">250</span><br>

<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="HOW_TO_JOIN_A_SERVER"></a>HOW TO
JOIN A SERVER</h3>

Verify that the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet</span>"
option is checked (1), select
a server from the list (2), enter your Username (3) and finally click
on the join server button (4) as shown in the following image<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 782px; height: 550px;" alt="" src="Imagesbrw/JoinServer_ENG.png"><br>
</div>

<br>

If you want to join the server as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Player
Administrator</span>, all you have to do is enter the <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Player Admin Password”</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

The servers that appear with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">padlock</span>
on the left side are with a password and to join you must enter the <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Game password”</span>.<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="HOW_TO_JOIN_UNLISTED_SERVERS"></a>HOW
TO JOIN UNLISTED SERVERS</h3>

If
you know a server that does not appear in the list and you know its IP
address and port, you can join the server in the following way:<br>

Just check the box, enter the server IP address and the Port, and
finally click the button to join server.<br>

<br>

</div>

<br>

If
you get this message after joining a server. It means that your game
does not have that map available or does not have the same version of
the server map. You must download the map and copy it to the Maps
folder in the game's installation directory. To download the map
try to contact the server owner.<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="LANPractice"></a>LAN/Practice</h3>

This
section allows you to create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">local
server</span> on your PC. Either to
explore the maps or practice alone or play with your friends on LAN.<br>

<br>

When
you create a local server in the server status section, the text
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Completed Loading”</span> should
appear as shown in the following image. When
this text appears it means that the server has finished loading and you
can now join it.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 782px; height: 550px;" alt="" src="Imagesbrw/CreateServer_ENG.png">&nbsp;<br>
</div>

<br>

To join the server you have two alternatives, you can do it through the
browser or from the game.<br>

<h4 style="color: yellow;"><a name="Join_the_created_server_through_the"></a>Join
the created server through the browser</h4>

Once the server has finished loading. In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Browser"</span> tab select the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">"LAN"</span> (1), select the server (2),
enter your username (3), click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Join

Run
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">“ArmyOps.exe”</span> file and
once inside the game you use the game
browser, go to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LAN section</span>
and there you will see the server listed
as shown in the following image, select the created server and click
the “Join server” button. <br>

you create a server with this option checked. A server will be created
in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CMD</span> so that if you
close the browser the server will not be
closed. Use this option if you plan to create a server and you do not
want it to close when the browser is closed.<br>

</div>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>
It is important that you understand that this section is only for
creating a local LAN server. It does not work to create a server over
the internet. If you want a server over the internet it is necessary to
perform additional tasks so that it works correctly and appears listed
in the browser.<br>

<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="CREATE_A_SERVER_OVER_THE_INTERNET_using"></a>CREATE A SERVER
OVER THE INTERNET (using your house connection)</h3>

Before
creating a server over the internet, you must be aware that by doing
you are assuming a responsibility. Since you have to ensure its proper
functioning, that is always available to players, and you also have the
responsibility to put order between the players if necessary.
Additionally you should be aware that not by mounting a server and that
appears in the browser list means that players will use your server. If
you want your server to be used you will have to attract players who
want to play in it and that means you will have to work on it.<br>

<br>

Done the warnings then let's start.<br>

<br>

The
following instructions assume that you want to create a server over the
internet that appears listed in the browser.&nbsp;And for this you need
a good internet connection. Your minimum upload speed must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">1 Mbit</span>.<br>

<br>

The first thing is to determine if you have a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Static IP</span> or a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic IP</span> (usually most internet
connections use Dynamic IP)<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the difference between a
static IP and a dynamic?</span><br>

A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Static IP address</span> is an
address that does not change. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic
IP
address</span> instead it is an address that changes every time you
turn off
or restart your modem/router.<br>

<br>

<h4 style="color: yellow;"><a name="SERVER_WITH_A_DYNAMIC_IP"></a>SERVER
WITH A DYNAMIC IP</h4>

It
is usually not advisable to mount a server of any kind with a dynamic
IP. Because this server would no longer be accessible to users when the
IP address changes. But fortunately there are <span style="font-weight: bold;">free services</span> on the
internet that allow you to mount a server with a dynamic IP. The
services that allow you to do this are called <span style="font-weight: bold;">DDNS (dynamic Domain Name
System)</span>. There are several companies that offer this service for
free
on the internet, you just have to look for them.<br>

<br>

With <span style="font-weight: bold;">DDNS</span>, you
will basically get a domain name <span style="font-weight: bold;">(example:
your_domain.ddns.net)</span> then
you will have to install on your pc a program that will update your
dynamic IP address so that your domain name is always linked to your
updated IP address. This way anyone who uses your domain name can
always access your server regardless of whether the IP of your modem
changes.<br>

<br>

So the first thing you need to do is get a domain name
through the companies that offer the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DDNS
service</span>. For this just follow
the instructions offered by each of the companies that offer this
service.<br>

<br>

The second thing you have to do is prepare your modem to
forward the ports that the server needs to be online. For this you will
have to review the manual of your modem and see how port forwarding is
done. The ports that you need to forward to have an AA server are: UDP<span style="font-weight: bold;">
1716</span>, UDP <span style="font-weight: bold;">1717</span> and UDP<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 7778</span>. <br>

<br>

Once you have properly configured the port
forwarding, you're practically ready to run your server. To do this,
run the browser, go to the LAN / Practice tab and create a server. It
is recommended that you check the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Run
server in CMD"</span> option so that
you do not accidentally close the server when closing the browser. To
prove that your server is online you can ask someone to connect using
the method to join an unlisted server, you must provide the IP address
of your modem and port 1716.<br>

<br>

The last thing you need to do is
make your server appear listed in the browser and for that the only
thing you have to do is to contact the Chevy's Place guys and ask them
to track your server.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

the manual of your modem and see how port forwarding is done. The ports
that you need to forward to have an AA server are: UDP<span style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

<h4 style="color: yellow;"><a name="CONSIDERATIONS_IN_PORTS"></a>CONSIDERATIONS
IN PORTS</h4>

<h4>Port 1716</h4>

It
is a port that you can change if necessary. To change this port, open
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">server.ini</span> file located in
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">System folder</span> of the
game's
installation directory, search for the section <span style="font-weight: bold;">[url]</span> and edit the line
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Port=1716</span>. Do not forget that
if you change this port, you must
forwarding in the modem<br>

<h4>Port 7778</h4>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the query port and
can not be modified by the user</span>. In case this port is busy, the
server
will automatically use the next free port to this one. It is
recommended to forward ports for a certain interval, for example, from
UDP port 7778 to 7790<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">IMPORTANT
NOTE:</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 153);"> In order for the
browser to
list a server, it is mandatory that your server use port <span style="font-weight: bold;">UDP 7778</span> as
query port otherwise it will not be listed in the browser.</span><br>

<br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="HOW_DO_I_CHANGE_THE_SCREEN_RESOLUTION_OF"></a>HOW DO I CHANGE
THE SCREEN RESOLUTION OF THE GAME</h3>

To
change the screen resolution of the game you can do it through the
Browser in the Settings tab or you can also do it by editing the file
ArmyOps.ini as detailed below.<br>

<br>

If
you’re desired resolution is not available, to change the screen
resolution of the game you need to open the file <span style="font-weight: bold;">ArmyOps.ini</span> that is
located in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">System folder</span>
in the installation directory of the game.<br>

Once
you have opened the file <span style="font-weight: bold;">ArmyOps.ini</span>
in the section
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[WinDrv.WindowsClient]</span> edit the
following lines as shown in the image.
Remember to save the changes.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 591px; height: 225px;" alt="" src="Imagesbrw/screenres.png"><br>
</div>

&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>
the original aspect ratio of the game is <span style="font-weight: bold;">4:3</span>. If you are going to
change the screen resolution for screens with aspect ratio <span style="font-weight: bold;">16:9</span> or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">16:10</span> then it is recommended
that you also change the <span style="font-weight: bold;">field of
View
(FOV)</span>. If you feel lazy to make the changes but you want to play
with a
good proportion of the image then play in window mode with <span style="font-weight: bold;">4:3</span>
proportions. <br>

<br>

<h3 style="color: yellow;"><a name="HOW_DO_I_MODIFY_THE_FOV_FIELD_OF"></a>HOW
DO I MODIFY THE FOV (FIELD OF VISION)</h3>

To
change the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOV</span> you need to
open the file <span style="font-weight: bold;">User.ini</span> that is
located in
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">System folder</span> in the
installation directory of the game.<br>

<br>

Once you have opened the file <span style="font-weight: bold;">User.ini</span>
in the section <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Engine.PlayerController]</span>
Find these lines:<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DesiredFOV=90.000000</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DefaultFOV=90.000000</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

Change
the values to set your <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOV </span>to
your preference. I recommend <span style="font-weight: bold;">90</span>
for <span style="font-weight: bold;">4:3</span>
displays, <span style="font-weight: bold;">100</span> for <span style="font-weight: bold;">16:10</span> displays, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">105</span> for <span style="font-weight: bold;">16:9</span> displays. Remember
to save the changes.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> About <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOV</span>, from experience I can say
that there are computers where it does not work, I think it depends on
the graphics card.<br>
