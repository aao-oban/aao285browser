Why do I get the message "DCDS Download" when I join a server?<br>
      <br>
R.- If you get this message after joining a server. It means that your
game does not have that map available or does not have the same version
of the server map. You must download the map and copy it to the Maps
folder in the game's installation directory. To download the map try to
contact the server owner or you can ask for help in the Shoutbox<br>
      <br>
why not all servers appear in the list ?<br>
      <br>
R.-This happens because the game uses the UDP protocol to send and
receive information from the servers. The UDP protocol is a protocol
that does not guarantee the arrival of information packets. if the AA
2.8.5 server Browser works in a Saturated network many of the UDP
packages will be lost and therefore some servers will not be listed.
For example, if you have an internet connection that you share with
other people if someone downloads or performs actions that consume much
of your bandwidth this will cause many of the UDP packages to be lost
and therefore some servers will not be listed.This problem is also very
common when you use a Wi-Fi connection due to the interference that
occurs between nearby Wi-Fi networks. This also causes the loss of UDP
packages.<br>

Why does not the shoutbox and the events section work?<br>
      <br>
R.- In order for the shoutbox and the events section to work, it is
necessary that your PC has Internet Explorer version 11 installed. this
for users with windows XP and windows 7<br>
